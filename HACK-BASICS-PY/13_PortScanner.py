#A port scanner helps identify open ports and associated services, giving clues about what software is in use (e.g., SSH, FTP, HTTP).

# üõ†Ô∏è Vulnerability Assessment:
# Once open ports are known, you can match them against known vulnerabilities (e.g., port 21 for FTP might be vulnerable if misconfigured).
# Helps determine if there‚Äôs a weak point in the network to exploit.

# üöÄ Automation:
# With Python, you can automate scanning multiple IPs and ports quickly.

# Easily extend your scanner to do banner grabbing, service detection, or even custom exploits after scanning.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Banner Grabbing is a technique used by hackers, penetration testers, and network administrators to collect information about a service running on an open port.
# When you connect to certain network services (like a web server, FTP, or SSH), they often respond with a "banner" ‚Äì a text message that includes:
# Service name
# Version number
# Sometimes even the OS or server configuration
