# scapy: Used for low-level packet crafting, sending, and receiving (e.g., ARP packets).
# socket: Used to resolve IP addresses to hostnames.
# threading: Enables concurrent scanning of multiple IPs.
# Queue: Thread-safe queue to store results.
# ipaddress: Helps in parsing and handling IP networks.

# This function sends an ARP request to a given IP address and captures the response.
